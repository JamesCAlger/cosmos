## Detailed Results

### Sample Queries Processed
All 20 queries were successfully processed through the modular pipeline:
1. Query processing with component orchestration
2. Embeddings generated via OpenAI
3. Retrieval via FAISS vector store
4. Answer generation via GPT-3.5-turbo

### Component Execution Flow
```
Documents → Chunker → Embedder → VectorStore (Index)
Query → Embedder → VectorStore (Search) → Generator → Answer
```

## Validation Conclusions

### ✅ Performance Validated
- Modular architecture adds minimal overhead (~10%)
- Performance is within acceptable range of Week 1
- All 20 queries processed successfully

### ✅ Quality Maintained/Improved
- RAGAS metrics remain perfect
- Semantic metrics show improvement
- Answer quality is consistent

### ✅ Architecture Advantages Confirmed
1. **Modularity**: Components can be swapped via configuration
2. **Extensibility**: New components can be added without core changes
3. **Testing**: Mock components work for development
4. **Configuration**: YAML-based pipeline definition works
5. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps
