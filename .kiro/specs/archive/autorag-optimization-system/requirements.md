# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AutoRAG is an automatic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture optimization system that discovers optimal configurations for any given dataset through intelligent search algorithms. The system eliminates manual tuning by automatically evaluating different RAG pipeline configurations and finding the best combination of chunking strategies, embedding models, retrieval methods, and generation parameters. This addresses the significant pain point where RAG optimization is currently time-consuming, requires deep expertise, and often results in suboptimal configurations due to limited manual exploration.
