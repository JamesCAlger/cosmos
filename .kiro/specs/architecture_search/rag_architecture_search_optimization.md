# RAG Architecture Search and Optimization

## Executive Summary

This document outlines strategies for optimizing RAG pipeline architectures when the search space grows from hundreds to millions of possible configurations. It covers the transition from simple parameter tuning to full architecture discovery, addressing the unique challenges of RAG systems compared to neural architecture search.

## The Scale Challenge

### Current State (Manageable)
- ~960 configurations with current components
- Tractable for grid search or simple Bayesian optimization
- 25% accuracy achieved with basic optimization

### Future State (Millions of Combinations)
- Multiple retrieval strategies with continuous blending weights
- Agentic components with numerous prompt patterns
- Dynamic routing and conditional components
- Continuous parameters creating infinite possibilities

## Why Traditional NAS Doesn't Apply to RAG

### Fundamental Differences

**No Weight Sharing**: Unlike neural networks where layers share mathematical properties, RAG components are heterogeneous operations (text chunking vs. database retrieval vs. LLM generation).

**No Gradient Flow**: RAG pipelines are discrete operations without differentiable connections, making gradient-based methods like DARTS inapplicable.

**No Supernetworks**: Cannot create an "over-parameterized RAG pipeline" containing all possible pipelines as subgraphs.

**External Dependencies**: Components rely on external services (APIs, databases) with fixed interfaces.

## Compositional Optimization: The Practical Solution

### Core Concept

Instead of optimizing millions of combinations jointly, decompose the problem into manageable sub-problems that can be optimized independently and composed.

### Optimization Hierarchy

#### Level 1: Micro-Optimizations (Individual Components)
- Optimize each component in isolation
- Example: Graph builder optimization for entity extraction accuracy
- ~100 configurations per component

#### Level 2: Meso-Optimizations (Workflows)
- Optimize tightly coupled component groups
- Example: Chunking + Retrieval joint optimization
- ~1000 configurations per workflow

#### Level 3: Macro-Optimizations (Pipeline Assembly)
- Combine optimized workflows
- Determine routing logic
- ~100 assembly options

### Mathematical Advantage

Instead of searching:
```
Total Space = C₁ × C₂ × C₃ × ... × Cₙ = 10^6 combinations
```

Compositional optimization searches:
```
Reduced Space = C₁ + C₂ + C₃ + ... + Cₙ = 10^3 evaluations
```

## Workflow Patterns and Transfer Learning

### Discovered Patterns

Through transfer learning across datasets, certain workflow patterns emerge:

#### Pattern 1: Entity-Heavy Documents
```
Documents → Entity Extractor → Graph Builder → Graph Retriever → Generator
```
- High entity confidence thresholds
- Dense graph connections
- Graph traversal for retrieval

#### Pattern 2: Long Technical Documents
```
Documents → Hierarchical Chunker → Hybrid Retriever → Cross-Encoder → Generator
```
- Large chunk sizes with overlap
- Combined BM25 + dense retrieval
- Heavy reranking for precision

#### Pattern 3: Conversational QA
```
Query → Query Expansion → Semantic Retriever → Contextual Generator
```
- Multiple query reformulations
- Embedding-based retrieval
- High temperature generation

### Transfer Learning Benefits

Workflows transfer predictably across domains:
- Medical → Scientific: 90% parameter transfer
- News → Blogs: 85% parameter transfer
- Legal → Financial: 70% parameter transfer

Start with transferred workflow, fine-tune locally.

## Handling Interface Conflicts

### The Problem

When optimizing workflows independently, interface mismatches arise:
- Chunking+Retrieval prefers BM25 with 250-token chunks
- Retrieval+Reranking prefers dense retrieval with 500-token chunks

### Resolution Strategies

#### 1. Interface Negotiation
Track compatibility scores between workflow outputs and inputs:
- BM25(250) → Reranker: Compatibility 0.6
- Dense(500) → Reranker: Compatibility 0.9

#### 2. Boundary Re-optimization
After initial optimization:
1. Fix downstream component
2. Re-optimize upstream with downstream in loop
3. Create "negotiated" interface

#### 3. Multiple Valid Paths
Maintain parallel optimized paths:
- Path A: Small chunks → BM25 → No reranker (fast)
- Path B: Large chunks → Dense → Reranker (accurate)

#### 4. Adapter Layers
Insert components to reconcile interfaces:
- Chunk Aggregator: Combines 250-token chunks into 500-token units
- Score Normalizer: Aligns BM25 and dense retrieval scores

## Multi-Objective Optimization with Composition

### Hierarchical Pareto Frontiers

#### Workflow Level
Each workflow has its own Pareto frontier:
- Chunking+Retrieval: 10 Pareto-optimal points
- Retrieval+Reranking: 8 Pareto-optimal points

#### Composition Level
Combine only Pareto-optimal workflows:
- 10 × 8 = 80 combinations instead of millions
- Prune dominated compositions
- Final frontier: 15-20 points

### Example Pareto Points

| Configuration | Latency | Cost | Accuracy |
|--------------|---------|------|----------|
| Fast & Cheap | 100ms | $0.01 | 70% |
| Balanced | 300ms | $0.03 | 85% |
| High Accuracy | 800ms | $0.08 | 92% |

## Predictor-Based Optimization at Scale

### When Predictors Excel (Your Current Scale)

With ~1000 configurations:
- Rich stage-wise metrics provide strong signals
- 50-100 evaluations sufficient for accurate predictions
- 95% reduction in required evaluations

### When Predictors Struggle (Millions Scale)

With millions of configurations:
- Insufficient coverage (seeing 0.01% of space)
- Complex interactions unpredictable
- Need advanced methods

### Advanced Predictor Strategies

#### Neural Architecture Predictors
- Graph neural networks operating on pipeline DAG
- Learn component interaction representations
- Transfer across similar architectures

#### Ensemble Predictors
- Multiple models with uncertainty quantification
- Know when extrapolating vs interpolating
- Confidence-weighted predictions

#### Multi-Fidelity Predictors
Train predictors at multiple fidelity levels:
- Level 0: Synthetic queries (instant)
- Level 1: 10 queries ($0.01)
- Level 2: 100 queries ($0.10)
- Level 3: 1000 queries ($1.00)

## Practical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Stage)
1. Implement basic metrics collection
2. Simple Bayesian optimization on fixed architecture
3. Understand component interactions
4. Build performance baselines

### Phase 2: Compositional Optimization
1. Identify natural workflow boundaries
2. Optimize workflows independently
3. Develop interface compatibility metrics
4. Compose optimized workflows

### Phase 3: Advanced Methods (If Needed)
1. Neural predictors for complex interactions
2. Population-based training for exploration
3. Meta-learning across tasks
4. Continuous architecture evolution

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### For Your Current System

1. **Start Simple**: External metrics + basic Bayesian optimization will provide 80% of the value

2. **Compositional Approach**: As you add components, group them into workflows to maintain tractability

3. **Transfer Learning**: Build a library of proven workflow patterns

4. **Interface Standards**: Define clear interfaces between components to enable composition

### Scaling Considerations

When your search space explodes:

1. **Never Search Full Space**: Use hierarchical decomposition

2. **Leverage Predictors**: Even imperfect predictions dramatically reduce evaluations

3. **Multi-Fidelity Is Essential**: Evaluate millions cheaply, refine top candidates

4. **Accept "Good Enough"**: 95% optimal with 0.1% search cost is the real win

## Tools and Frameworks

### Recommended for Current Scale
- **scikit-optimize**: Bayesian optimization with multi-objective support

## Conclusion

RAG architecture optimization differs fundamentally from neural architecture search due to:
- Heterogeneous components with external dependencies
- Clear interface boundaries enabling decomposition
- Rich intermediate metrics for prediction
- Transfer learning opportunities across domains

The compositional optimization approach provides a practical path from hundreds to millions of configurations by:
- Decomposing into manageable sub-problems
- Leveraging transfer learning aggressively
- Building on proven patterns
- Accepting near-optimal solutions

Focus on building robust workflows with standardized interfaces. This investment will pay dividends as your system grows from simple pipelines to complex, adaptive architectures.
