    "# COSMOS: A New Approach to System Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is COSMOS?\n",
    "\n",
    "COSMOS (Compositional Optimization for Modular Systems) is a framework that transforms how we optimize complex machine learning pipelines. Instead of treating systems as monolithic black boxes, COSMOS recognizes and leverages the natural modularity present in modern ML workflows to achieve dramatic improvements in optimization efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Innovation\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional optimization approaches struggle with the curse of dimensionality. When optimizing a pipeline with multiple components, each having numerous parameters, the configuration space explodes exponentially. A typical RAG pipeline might have millions of possible configurations, making exhaustive search impractical and expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "COSMOS solves this through **compositional decomposition** - breaking down the optimization problem into manageable, independent sub-problems that can be solved efficiently and then composed into an optimal whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hierarchical Optimization\n",
    "COSMOS operates at three distinct levels:\n",
    "- **Micro-level**: Individual component optimization (e.g., tuning chunk size)\n",
    "- **Meso-level**: Workflow optimization for tightly coupled components (e.g., retriever and reranker working together)\n",
    "- **Macro-level**: System assembly and routing decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interface Contracts\n",
    "Components communicate through well-defined interfaces, ensuring that optimized components can work together seamlessly. Each component guarantees certain outputs while accepting specific inputs, enabling independent optimization without breaking the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bounded Agency\n",
    "Components can make internal decisions within defined boundaries. This allows for adaptive behavior while maintaining system predictability and composition guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Multi-Objective Awareness\n",
    "COSMOS simultaneously optimizes for multiple goals - accuracy, latency, and cost - finding Pareto-optimal configurations that represent the best trade-offs for different use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How COSMOS Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three-Phase Process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1: Component Independence**\n",
    "Each component is optimized in isolation, finding its best configurations for the given task. This reduces the search space from multiplicative to additive complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: Workflow Harmony**\n",
    "Groups of components that work closely together are jointly optimized, ensuring they complement each other effectively. Interface negotiations ensure smooth data flow between components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3: System Assembly**\n",
    "The optimized components and workflows are assembled into a complete pipeline, with routing and fallback mechanisms configured for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power of Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "COSMOS collects detailed metrics at every stage of the pipeline, not just the final output. This rich signal enables:\n",
    "- Early stopping of poor configurations\n",
    "- Correlation analysis between intermediate and final performance\n",
    "- Transfer learning across similar tasks\n",
    "- Predictive performance modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Optimizing a RAG Pipeline with COSMOS\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through how COSMOS would optimize a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for a customer support chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial System Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG pipeline consists of five main components:\n",
    "1. **Document Chunker**: Splits documents into searchable segments\n",
    "2. **Retriever**: Finds relevant chunks for a query\n",
    "3. **Reranker**: Refines and orders retrieved results\n",
    "4. **Generator**: Produces answers using retrieved context\n",
    "5. **Validator**: Ensures answer quality and accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Without COSMOS, optimizing this pipeline would require testing 960 different configurations to explore all combinations - expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### COSMOS Optimization Process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Component Isolation (40% of budget)\n",
    "\n",
    "COSMOS first optimizes each component independently:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunker Optimization**\n",
    "- Tests chunk sizes (128, 256, 512 tokens)\n",
    "- Evaluates overlap ratios (10%, 20%, 30%)\n",
    "- Finds that 256 tokens with 20% overlap provides best information preservation\n",
    "- *Result*: 3x improvement in chunk relevance scores\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retriever Optimization**\n",
    "- Compares dense, sparse, and hybrid retrieval strategies\n",
    "- Tunes the number of retrieved documents (5, 10, 20)\n",
    "- Discovers hybrid retrieval with top-10 results works best for technical queries\n",
    "- *Result*: 40% improvement in recall@10\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generator Optimization**\n",
    "- Tests temperature settings (0.0 to 1.0)\n",
    "- Evaluates token limits (256, 512, 1024)\n",
    "- Finds temperature 0.3 with 512 tokens balances accuracy and conciseness\n",
    "- *Result*: 25% reduction in hallucinations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Workflow Optimization (40% of budget)\n",
    "\n",
    "COSMOS identifies that retriever and reranker form a tightly coupled workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retriever-Reranker Negotiation**\n",
    "- Retriever is adjusted to fetch 15 documents (slightly more than needed)\n",
    "- Reranker is configured to select top 5 with high confidence threshold\n",
    "- Interface ensures consistent document scoring between components\n",
    "- *Result*: 60% improvement in precision@5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generator-Validator Workflow**\n",
    "- Generator adjusted to provide confidence scores with answers\n",
    "- Validator configured with three strategies: pass-through (high confidence), inline correction (medium), regeneration (low)\n",
    "- *Result*: 95% answer accuracy with minimal regeneration overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: System Assembly (20% of budget)\n",
    "\n",
    "COSMOS assembles the optimized pipeline with intelligent routing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration Selection**\n",
    "Based on the optimization results, COSMOS identifies three Pareto-optimal configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Fast Response\"** (Customer Service Priority)\n",
    "   - Accuracy: 80%, Latency: 0.5s, Cost: $0.01/query\n",
    "   - Uses smaller models, aggressive caching, minimal validation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"Balanced\"** (General Purpose)\n",
    "   - Accuracy: 90%, Latency: 1.2s, Cost: $0.03/query\n",
    "   - Standard configuration with moderate validation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"High Accuracy\"** (Critical Information)\n",
    "   - Accuracy: 95%, Latency: 2.0s, Cost: $0.08/query\n",
    "   - Comprehensive retrieval, strict validation, regeneration enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before COSMOS Optimization:**\n",
    "- Accuracy: 25% (many irrelevant or incorrect answers)\n",
    "- Latency: 2.5 seconds average\n",
    "- Cost: $0.10 per query\n",
    "- Configuration attempts: Would need 960 to find optimal\n",
    "\n",
    "**After COSMOS Optimization:**\n",
    "- Accuracy: 45-55% (depending on configuration chosen)\n",
    "- Latency: 0.5-2.0 seconds (configurable)\n",
    "- Cost: $0.01-$0.08 per query\n",
    "- Configuration attempts: Only 48 needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Improvements:**\n",
    "- 80-120% improvement in accuracy\n",
    "- 52% reduction in latency (balanced mode)\n",
    "- 70% reduction in cost (balanced mode)\n",
    "- 95% reduction in optimization time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why COSMOS Succeeded\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intelligent Decomposition**: By optimizing components separately, COSMOS avoided testing redundant combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rich Metrics**: Intermediate metrics (chunk relevance, retrieval recall) provided early signals of configuration quality\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interface Contracts**: Well-defined boundaries ensured optimized components worked together seamlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Found multiple optimal configurations for different use cases rather than a single \"best\" solution\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transfer Learning**: Patterns learned from optimizing similar RAG systems accelerated the process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of COSMOS\n",
    "\n",
